## Assignment 2 : Unconstrained Optimization techniques
<br/>  The major search methods covered in this assignment are :
  * `Unrestricted search` method with `fixed step size`
  * `Unrestricted search` method with `accelerated step size`
  * `Exhaustive` search method
  * `Dichotomous` search method
  * `Interval Halving` method
  * `Fibonacci` method
  * `Golden Section` method

This assignment is a mixed assignment comprising :
*  Manual calculations
*  Programming 

<br/> _**Relative efficiencies are compared**_ and comments on the behaviour are made and documented in the report.
